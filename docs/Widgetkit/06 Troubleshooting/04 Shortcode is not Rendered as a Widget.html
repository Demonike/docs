<h1 class="title">Shortcode is not Rendered as a Widget</h1>

<p>Sometimes, visual editors in your CMS will modify the shortcode without you noticing. We are always working on making sure all major editors are supported.</p>

<h2>Supported editors</h2>
<p>Currently, shortcodes are known to work well with the following editor:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plain textarea (no editor enabled)</li>
    <li>JCE</li>
    <li>RokPad</li>
    <li>TinyMCE</li>
    <li>CodeMirror</li>
    <li>Ace</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not supported</h2>
<p>Not supported at the moment, but coming soon:</p>
<ul>
    <li>CK editor</li>
</ul>
