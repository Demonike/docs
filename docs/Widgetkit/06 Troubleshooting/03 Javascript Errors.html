<h1 class="title">JavaScript errors</h1>

<p class="article-lead">Learn, how to handle JavaScript issues and prevent errors.</p>

<p>Almost every Joomla extension uses JavaScript, relying on a library like <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Using different scripts on a webpage can cause conflicts between them.</p>

<h2>How to detect errors?</h2>

<p>If your website does not work as you expect when you click something or an animation stopped working, this could be due to a script error. In this case the script execution will be stopped by the browser.</p>

<p>The following developer tools show you script-errors including information about what went wrong, the file and line number and the source code that caused the error.</p>

      <td><em>Browser Debug Console</em></td>
      <td>One way is using the browser's debug console on the page where the error occurs. It will help you to identify the scripts and their related files on your webserver.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><em>Firebug and other browser WDT</em></td>
      <td><a href="https://getfirebug.com/">Firebug for Firefox</a> allows you to inspect and non-destructively edit HTML and also includes a powerful JavaScript debugger. Other browsers like Chrome, Safari or Opera already have similar built-in tools.</td>

<h2>How to resolve errors?</h2>

<p>Usually the errors are caused by an extension or combination of multiple extensions. If you've detected a JavaScript error on a page, you need to find its origin.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Once you have identified the extension, try to <em>disable</em> it to make sure your page works without any errors again.</li>
  <li>If the error is gone, you've found the extension causing the conflict.</li>
  <li>Now you can look for the <em>extensions configuration option</em> and see, if it lets you enable/disable loading a JavaScript library like jQuery to resolve the errors.</li>
</ol>
