<h2>Editors</h2>

<p>Sometimes, visual editors in your CMS will prevent the Widgetkit button to display. You can still insert and modify shortcodes manually, but you will not be able to open the visual editor. If you cannot see the Widgetkit button, try a different editor to see if that works. We are always working on making sure all major editors are supported.</p>

<h2>Supported editors</h2>
<p>There are no known issues with the following editors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plain textarea (no editor enabled)</li>
