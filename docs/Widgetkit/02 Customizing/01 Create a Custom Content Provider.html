<h1 class="title">Create a Custom Content Provider</h1>

<p>
    Widgetkit is very modular and extendable by design. You can easily add your own content providers or widget renderer. Both, content provider and widget renderer, are plugins. You find them in the plugin folder of Widgetkit:
</p>

<p>For Joomla<br><code>administrator/components/com_widgetkit/plugins/</code></p>
<p>For Wordpress<br><code>wp-content/plugins/widgetkit/plugins/</code></p>

<p>
    To create a new content provider or widget renderer just put it in the corresponding folder and it will be loaded automatically. If you are using a Warp 7 theme you can also put them in the theme folder.
</p>

<p>
    For example<br>
    <code>THEME-NAME/widgetkit/content/PROVIDER-NAME</code><br>
    <code>THEME-NAME/widgetkit/widgets/WIDGET-NAME</code>
</p>
