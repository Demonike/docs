<h1 class="title">Create a Custom Content Provider</h1>

<p>
    Widgetkit is very modular and extendable by design, you can easily add your own content provider plugin. You can find the inbuild ones in the Widgetkit plugin folder, <code>administrator/components/com_widgetkit/plugins/content</code> for Joomla and <code>wp-content/plugins/widgetkit/plugins/content</code> for WordPress.
</p>

<p>
    To create a new content provider we recommend you to copy one of the inbuilds ones and customise it to your needs, but in order to make it update-proof store it outside Widgetkit. For information about where to store it, please checkout the {doc: create-a-custom-holder text:Create a Custom Holder Plugin} doc.

<h2>Plugin Structure</h2>

<p>
    A typical content plugin would have the following file structure
</p>
    
<pre><code>
+-- assets/             // The assets folder
|      controller.js    // AngularJS controller
+-- views/              // The views folder
|      edit.php         // AngularJS view layout
|-- plugin.php          // The main plugin file
</code></pre>
