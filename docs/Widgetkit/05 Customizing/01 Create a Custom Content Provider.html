<h1 class="title">Create a Custom Content Provider</h1>

<p>
    Widgetkit is very modular and extendable by design. You can easily add your own content providers or widget plugin. Both, content provider and widget plugin, are plugins. You can find them in the plugin folder of Widgetkit:
</p>

<p>For Joomla<br><code>administrator/components/com_widgetkit/plugins/</code></p>
<p>For WordPress<br><code>wp-content/plugins/widgetkit/plugins/</code></p>

<p>
    To create a new content provider or widget plugin, just put it in the corresponding folder and it will be loaded automatically. If you are using a Warp 7 theme you can also put them in the theme folder.
</p>

<p>
    For example<br>
    <code>THEME-NAME/widgetkit/content/PROVIDER-NAME</code><br>
    <code>THEME-NAME/widgetkit/widgets/WIDGET-NAME</code>
</p>
