<h1>Content Manager</h1>

<p>In Widgetkit 2 content and widgets are decoupled, so that you can create them independently, widgets directly from the WordPress or Joomla editor and the content through the content manager.</p>

<p>When opening Widgetkit you'll see a <em>New Content</em> button with a select form that allows you to choose between creating custom content and loading content from Wordpress, Joomla, ZOO, K2 and Woocommerce.</p>

<h2>Custom Content</h2>

<p>When creating content for your widget, hit <em>Add Item</em> to add single content items. Alternatively you hit <em>Add Media</em> to select multiple items at once through the media library or manager of your CMS. Once you have selected an image, a preview will be visible below the media field. You can also type in the path directly. The WordPress media manager only allows you to access the upload folder. This is where being able to type your own the path comes in handy, so you can use a different folder structure.</p>

<p>In the Content field you can add text or Markup to be displayed as a caption or any other kind of content, depending on the widget renderer. You can also add a link to each content item. When configurating the widget, you will determine, how to display the link. For example, it can be a button or an image overlay.</p>
