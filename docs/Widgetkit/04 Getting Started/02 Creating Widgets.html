<h1 class="title">Creating Widgets</h1>

<p>In this tutorial you'll learn how to create widgets and get an insight of the general structure of Widgetkit.</p>

<h2>In the CMS editor</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Inside the editor of your CMS hit the <em>Widgetkit</em> button. This will open Widgetkit in a lightbox.</li>
    <li>Pick the widget you want to be rendered. Currently, Widgetkit includes a Slideshow, Switcher, Map, Grid and Grid stack widget. Some themes also provide their own custom widgets. For more information, take a look at the {doc:widget-renderers text:Widget Renderers} doc.</li>
    <li>Assign your content to the widget renderer. You can either choose your content from the select form above or create a new content set through the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager}.</li>
    <li>If necessary, you can change the configurations of the widget renderer, like animations and display options or add a custom class to your widget.</li>
    <li>Hit <em>Insert</em> and a shortcode will be added to the article or module, representing your newly created widget.</li>
</ol>

<h3>WordPress widget or Joomla module</h3>

<p>
    Widgetkit also provides a WordPress Widget or Joomla module. Just go to <em>Appearance Â» Widgets</em> and drag and drop the Widgetkit widget to any theme position. In Joomla create a new Module in the <em>Module Manager</em> and select <em>Widgetkit</em> as the Module Type. The editor will then display a <em>Select Widget</em> button which opens the Widgetkit dialog.
</p>

<h2>Content and Widgets</h2>

<p>
    In Widgetkit 2 content and widgets are decoupled. This means that you can create content independently from the widgets in a separate Content Manager, which is accessible from the Widget Manager lightbox as well as directly from the Widgetkit menu item of your CMS. For more information, take a look at the {doc:content-manager text:Content Manager} doc.
</p>

<h3>Shortcodes</h3>

<p>
    Shortcodes are a very popular concept from Wordpress which allows you to easily publish dynamic content without any programming knowledge. Basically you insert a shortcode in a WordPress post or Joomla article and it will be rendered as a widget, for example a slideshow which loads dynamic content from your CMS.
</p>

<p>
    All shortcodes include the id of the content that you want to display and a widget renderer. In this example, we render the content with the id 1 using the Slideshow widget with the default options.
</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="1" widget="slideshow"]</code></pre>

<p>A more andvanced shortcode with custom options would look like this.</p>

<pre><code>[widgetkit id="1" widget="slideshow" animation="swipe" autoplay=1]</code></pre>

<p>
    In this example the Slideshow uses the Swipe animation and autoplay is enabled. If you want to edit your widget afterwards, you need to click inside the shortcode before hitting the Widgetkit button. Otherwise you can only create a new widget.  For more information, take a look at the {doc:shortcodes text:Shortcodes} doc.
