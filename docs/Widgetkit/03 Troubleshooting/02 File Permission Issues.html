<h1 class="title">Permission Issues</h1>

<p>
	On your webserver, different files and directories have permissions that specify who and what can read, write, modify and access them. This is important because Widgetkit need access to write to files in to the cache directory to enable its caching functionality needed for assets and image galleries etc.
</p>

<p>After installing Widgetkit make sure that the cache directory is writable.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Joomla: <em>/cache/widgetkit</em></li>
	<li>WordPress: <em>/wp-content/plugins/widgetkit/cache</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Use your FTP client to change the permission on your webserver.</p>

<div class="box-warning">Always avoid 777 permissions. If your webserver has problems with the CHMOD 755, you can also try 775 and lastely 777 in this order.</div>

<h2>Changing File Permissions</h2>

<p>So how do you change the permissions for files and directories? Here are two step-by-step guides.</p>

<h3>Using your FTP client</h3>

<ol class="bullet">
	<li>Open your FTP client or if you don't have any download <a href="http://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a> and install it.</li>
	<li>Use your FTP client to login to your server and browse to your webroot directory.</li>
	<li>Right click on a directory which you want to change the permissions on and click <em>File Permissions...</em>.</li>
	<li>The <em>Change File Attributes</em> dialog, let's you check the options as shown below or type a numeric value like <em>755</em>. Make sure the <em>Recurse into subdirectories</em> option is checked. Then hit the <em>OK</em> button.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<div class="box-info">Tip: After applying new permissions some FTP clients require the file view to be refreshed. Otherwise the old permissions will continue to show...</div>

<div class="box-warning">Using a FTP client may also change file ownership to the FTP user of the files/directories you changed the permissions on. This can cause problems on some webservers. To avoid this you can use a Joomla component like eXtplorer to update the permission through the Joomla administration.</div>

<h3>Using the eXtplorer Joomla component</h3>
<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Download <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/core-enhancements/file-management/2630">eXtplorer</a> file manager Joomla component and install it. It allows you to edit, delete, copy, rename, archive and unpack files/directories directly on your webserver.</li>
		<li>Login to your Joomla administration, go to the eXtplorer component and browse to the directory which you want to change the permissions on.</li>
		<li>Right click on the directory and choose <em>Change Rights</em></li>
		<li>Check the options as shown below. Make sure the <em>Recurse into subdirectories</em> option is checked. Then hit the <em>Save</em> button.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
