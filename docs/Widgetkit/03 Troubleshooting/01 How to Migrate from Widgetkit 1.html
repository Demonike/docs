<h1 class="title">How to Migrate from Widgetkit 1</h1>

<p>Widgetkit 2 has a completely new approach to widget management compared to Widgetkit 1. The back end has a completely different logic and we support different kinds of widgets. That is why there is no possible upgrade path from Widgetkit 1.x to Widgetkit 2.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is also NOT possible to run both Widgetkit 1.x and 2 at the same time. You have to decide which version you want to use. If you are satisfied with Widgetkit 1.x there is no need to move to the new version. If you start with a new site we recommend using Widgetkit 2.</p>

<p>If you still want or beed to migrate your content from Widgetkit 1.x to 2, a possible solution is to get a full dump of your current website on your local system. There, you can remove Widgetkit 1, install the new version and recreate your widgets one by one. When you are done, you can update the online version with your prepared offline version. That way, you limit downtime of your live site to a minimum.</p>
